Current blocks in order of priority:

bl_scrunch and h52fil.py
    * The cmd_tool does not accept arguments passed into the function (since it is supposed to be run from the command line).
    * However, there is one script which allows this: guppi.py
        * So far as I can tell, there is one key difference which prevents me from simply modifying, e.g., bl_scrunch directly to have the cmd_tool accept arguments.
        * These scripts simultaneously define 'opts', and I am not sure what this variable's precise purpose is.
            * opts, args = p.parse_args(sys.argv[1:])
            * We even have a different parser object in these scenarios:
                from optparse import OptionParser
                ...
                p = OptionParser()

match_fils
    * script can only be run on BL machines,
        therefore we want to deprecate

__init__.py
    * This script serves to acquire the most imports possible for the user. A single codecov report is by definition not ever going to hit 100% on this...
