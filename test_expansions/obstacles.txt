Current progress:
dice: 53 -> 63%
    38 misses now
match_fils: 18 -> 31%
    test_match_fits.py is an all-new file
    Deprecation notice! Should be 100%
    51 misses now
guppy: 49-> >57%
    something is really slow. I may have just eaten up too
    much RAM, but I had to ice that last test
   
    that is at most 117 misses

That is a dry run of about 2% increase in overall coverage!


Current blocks:

bl_scrunch
    * The cmd_tool does not accept arguments passed into the function (since it is supposed to be run from the command line).

match_fils
    * script can only be run on BL machines,
        therefore we want to deprecate
