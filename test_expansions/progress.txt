Current progress:
we need to repair bl_scrunch ASAP!!

dice: 53 -> 63%
    38 misses now
match_fils: 18 -> 31%
    test_match_fits.py is an all-new file
    Deprecation notice! Should be 100%
    51 misses now
guppy: 49->59% (110 misses) -> 70% (82 misses) -> 72%F (77m)
    something is really slow.
    This 59% took us 507 seconds
h52fil: 50->82% (8 misses)
fil2h5: 50->82% (8 misses)

file_wrappy: 101 misses -> 84 misses

I am still fairly upset about
    guppy
    dice

    fdile_wrapper just makes me sad

Remaining open cases:

waterfall
    > We were able to restore up to 59 misses by running
        waterfall_test alone. Now we need to check if the
        entire testing suite will synergize.

I am guessing that the dozen (of misses across all plotting calls)
is due to obscure if statements, but you should still give these
a look-see, maybe you can eke out another point worth of coverage.
